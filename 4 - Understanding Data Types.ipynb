    "2. Avoiding Data Duplication: Storing full names in a single column might lead to data duplication. For example, if two drivers have the same last name but different first names, you would end up repeating the last name for each entry, which wastes storage space and may make the database harder to maintain.\n",

    "3. Data Integrity: Splitting names into two columns enhances data integrity. It ensures that each name component is stored separately and reduces the risk of unintentional data corruption or errors."
